{ first_time } npc: what do you want to talk about?
{ not first_time } npc: not
{ first_time && second_time } npc: what do you want to talk about?
{ first_time and second_time or third_time } npc: what do you want to talk about?
{ first_time or second_time and third_time } npc: what do you want to talk about?
{ first_time and second_time or third_time and fourth_time } npc: what do you want to talk about?

{ first_time == second_time or third_time != fourth_time } equality
{ first_time is second_time or third_time isnt fourth_time } alias equality

{ first_time < second_time or third_time > fourth_time } alias equality
{ first_time <= second_time and third_time >= fourth_time } alias equality

{ first_time > x + y - z * d / e % b } a

{set xx = true } { first_time > 0 } hey
{ first_time != null } ho
{ first_time is false } let's go
{ first_time is "hello darkness >= my old friend" } let's go
{ set first_time = 2 }
{ set a = b = c = d = 3 }
{ set a += b }
{ set a -= 4 ^ 2 }

trigger {trigger some_event}
{trigger another_event}

hey you { set a -= 4, b=1, c = "hello" }

{ first_time > 0 } "hey {you}" {set a = 4}

{ set hp = 5 }

* { hp < 40 } Life { set s = false }
  player: I want to talk about life! {set x = true }
  npc: Well! That's too complicated...
* The universe
  player: I want to talk about the universe!
  npc: That's too complex! { set last_talk = "universe" }
* {first_time && hp > 10} Everything else...
  {hp > 20 || count == 0} player: What about everything else?
  npc: I don't have time for this...

(
  - { hp > 50 } all good
  - { hp < 10 } I'm in trouble
)
