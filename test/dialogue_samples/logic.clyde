-- logic example

-- assignments
{ set some_value = 1 } variable was initialized with %some_value%
{ set a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 } setting multiple variables
{ set some_value += a += b } %some_value% == 4.  %a% == 3
{ set some_new_value ?= 3 } variable was initialized with %some_new_value%
{ set some_new_value ?= 4 } variable remains as %some_new_value% when init assign

--  conditions
{ a == 1 } Hello!
{ a == 2 || a != 3 } Hi!
Hello { when a == 2 }

{ not bl }
  This is a block
  inside a condition


-- events
{ trigger some_event }
{ trigger some_event, another_event }
