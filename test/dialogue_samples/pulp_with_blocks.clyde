== about hash
Jules: Is hash legal there?
Vincent: Yes, but is ain't a hundred percent legal.
         I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint,
         and start puffin' away. You're only supposed to smoke in
         your home or certain designated places.
Jules: Those are hash bars?
Vincent: Yeah, it breaks down like this\: it's legal to buy it,
         it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a
         hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it,
         which doesn't really matter ' cause - get a load of this -
         if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you.
         Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.
Jules: That did it, man - I'm f**n' goin', that's all there is to it.

         Vincent: You know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
         Jules: what?
         Vincent: It's the little differences. A lotta the same sh*t we got here,
                  they got there, but there they're a little different.
